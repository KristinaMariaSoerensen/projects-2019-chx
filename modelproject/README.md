## Model analysis project

# The Keynesian Cross

This project analyses a small economy and how the production in the short run is affected by shifts in net export. The model is analyzed with exogenous and endogenous taxes respectively. We see how this affects the economy's ability to withstand shifts in exogenous variables.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation the project requires no further installations.
